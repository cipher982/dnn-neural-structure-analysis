# dnn-neural-structure-analysis
Looking at different network architectures on DNN performance in TensorFlow. I trained a combination of Fully Connected Models on a wide range of designs from 1-10 hidden layers, and 1-512 nodes per layer. 

### The Data
**Reuters** - Dataset of 11,228 newswires from Reuters, labeled over 46 topics.

**IMDB** - Dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative).
